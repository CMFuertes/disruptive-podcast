        <p>Hey my worriers! I am Jamie Burgos. ½ of Disruptive Latina’s!
          I am of Puerto Rican decent. I was born in Boston, Massachusetts, but now reside in sunny South Florida. I have always been passionate about helping others, even when I had no idea that it was what I was destined for. I have always been strong willed, confident and very direct. All of these characteristic traits have not always helped me rise to the top that most deem successful as a woman but it has taken me to my own personal success’ and that is the only success that matters to me. I have worked since I was 14 years old and now at 39 I am finally well aware of where I want to go in life. I love travel, art, learning about people’s difference and cultures. I love teaching others about whatever I know and have learned on my travels and personal experiences. I am very good at listening to others when I have enough energy, and making people feel like they are heard. I have experienced a lot of different cultures in my travels and have found immense peace and humility knowing that there are other cultures other than my own that are very proud, respectful and fun. I have worked 4 jobs in my life and I was told once that I would have at least 6 by the age of 50 so this Podcast may count as 5. I have worked at a grocery chain, dry cleaners and have spent my late teens and 20’s in the food distribution industry. This is where my journey in accounting sparked. I started as a fill in to do data entry, filing and basic office duties. This place was male dominant and very toxic. I worked hard for 3 years and was moved up to Office Manager/Book keeper/Jr. Accountant/HR, and Benefits Coordinator. I wore many hats, too many if you ask me. I spent 12 long years there. After finishing college you are supposed to feel like you are ready to take on the world right? LOL I was feeling stuck with no possibility of moving up, being a young woman and having to fight for every lousy raise, I decided I deserve more. I put on my big girl panties, dusted myself off, put in my notice and I said F this toxic complacent place! I moved on to the fitness world where I started in book keeping/accounting and worked my way up to Procurement Manager for a chain of gyms where I have been happily for 9 years. I am working on a book which will talk about my life and traumas that have shaped me and has turn me into the warrior you see today. I have dove into Podcasting with my lovely Titi Jackie (Dr. Jackeline Mejias-Fuertes to you) where I hope to help, motivate and show you how much of a warrior you are as well!
